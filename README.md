In search of a key driver for the invasive growth of cancer metastasis, AKT2 is found to be exceptionally expressed in colorectal cancer and its metastasis. Again, exceeding genomic arrangements of AKT2 can be held responsible for HGSC (High-grade serous ovarian cancer) and breast cancer cell metastasis. This project aims to classify among active and inactive AKT2 inhibitors, collected from the CHEMBL database using eight supervised machine learning models based on four lipinski molecular descriptors.
